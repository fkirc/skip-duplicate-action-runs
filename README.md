# Skip Duplicate Actions

`skip-duplicate-actions` provides the following features to optimize GitHub Actions:

- [Skip duplicate workflow-runs](#skip-duplicate-workflow-runs) after merges, pull requests or similar.
- [Skip ignored paths](#skip-ignored-paths) to speedup documentation-changes or similar.
- [Skip if paths not changed](#skip-if-paths-not-changed) for something like directory-specific tests.
- [Cancel outdated workflow-runs](#cancel-outdated-workflow-runs) after branch-pushes.

All of those features help to save time and costs; especially for long-running workflows.
You can choose any subset of those features.

## Skip duplicate workflow-runs

If you work with feature branches, then you might see lots of _duplicate workflow-runs_.
For example, duplicate workflow-runs can happen if a workflow runs on a feature branch, but then the workflow is repeated right after merging the feature branch.
`skip-duplicate-actions` helps to prevent such unnecessary runs.

- **Full traceability:** After clean merges, you will see a message like `Skip execution because the exact same files have been successfully checked in <previous_run_URL>`.
- **Skip concurrent workflow-runs:** If the same workflow is unnecessarily triggered twice, then one of the workflow-runs will be skipped.
  For example, this can happen when you push a tag right after pushing a commit.
- **Fully configurable:** By default, manual triggers and cron will never be skipped.
- **Flexible Git usage:** `skip-duplicate-actions` does not care whether you use fast-forward-merges, rebase-merges or squash-merges.
  However, if a merge yields a result that is different from the source branch, then the resulting workflow-run will _not_ be skipped.
  This is commonly the case if you merge "outdated branches".

## Skip ignored paths

In many projects, it is unnecessary to run all tests for documentation-only-changes.
Therefore, GitHub provides a [paths-ignore](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) feature out of the box.
However, GitHub's `paths-ignore` has some limitations:

- GitHub's `paths-ignore` fails to look at previous commits. This means that the outcome depends on how often you push changes.
- Consequently, GitHub's `paths-ignore` does not work for [required checks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-required-status-checks).
  If you path-ignore a required check, then pull requests will block forever without being mergeable.

To overcome those limitations, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides a more flexible `paths_ignore`-feature with an efficient backtracking-algorithm.
Instead of stupidly looking at the current commit, `paths_ignore` will look for successful checks in your commit-history.

## Skip if paths not changed

In some projects, there are tasks that should be only executed if specific sub-directories were changed.
Therefore, GitHub provides a [paths](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) feature out of the box.
However, GitHub's `paths` has some limitations:

- GitHub's `paths` cannot skip individual steps in a workflow.
- GitHub's `paths` does not work with required checks that you really want to pass successfully.

To overcome those limitations, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides a more sophisticated `paths`-feature.
Instead of blindly skipping checks, the backtracking-algorithm will only skip something if it can find a suitable check in your commit-history.

## Cancel outdated workflow-runs

Typically, workflows should only run for the most recent commit.
Therefore, when you push changes to a branch, `skip-duplicate-actions` will cancel any previous workflow-runs that run against outdated commits.

- **Full traceability:** If a workflow-run is cancelled, then you will see a message like `Cancelled <previous_run_URL>`.
- **Guaranteed execution:** The cancellation-algorithm guarantees that a complete check-set will finish no matter what.

## Inputs

### `github_token`

**Required** Your access token for GitHub.

### `paths_ignore`

A JSON-array with ignored path-patterns, e.g. something like `'["**/README.md", "**/docs/**"]'`.
See [cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet) for path-pattern examples.
See [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) for details about supported path-patterns.
Default `[]`.

### `paths`

A JSON-array with path-patterns, e.g. something like `'["platform-specific/**"]'`.
If this is non-empty, then `skip-duplicate-actions` will try to skip commits that did not change any of those paths.
It uses the same syntax as `paths_ignore`.
Default `[]`.

### `cancel_others`

If true, then workflow-runs from outdated commits will be cancelled. Default `true`.

### `do_not_skip`

A JSON-array with triggers that should never be skipped. Default `'["workflow_dispatch", "schedule"]'`.

### `concurrent_skipping`

If false, unfinished workflow-runs will be safely ignored. default `true`.

## Outputs

### `should_skip`

true if the current run can be safely skipped. This should be evaluated for either individual steps or entire jobs.

## Usage examples

You can use `skip-duplicate-actions` to either skip individual steps or entire jobs.
To minimize changes to existing jobs, it is often easier to skip entire jobs.

### Option 1: Skip entire jobs

To skip entire jobs, you should add a `pre_job` that acts as a pre-condition for your `main_job`.
Although this example looks like a lot of code, there are only two additional lines in your project-specific `main_job` (the `needs`-clause and the `if`-clause):

```yml
jobs:
  pre_job:
    # continue-on-error: true # Uncomment once integration is finished
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Map a step output to a job output
    outputs:
      should_skip: ${{ steps.skip_check.outputs.should_skip }}
    steps:
      - id: skip_check
        uses: fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions@master
        with:
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
          paths_ignore: '["**/README.md", "**/docs/**"]'

  main_job:
    needs: pre_job
    if: ${{ needs.pre_job.outputs.should_skip != 'true' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running slow tests..." && sleep 30
```

### Option 2: Skip individual steps

The following example demonstrates how to skip an individual step with an `if`-clause and an `id`.
In this example, the step will be skipped if no files in `src/` or `dist/` were changed:

```yml
jobs:
  skip_individual_steps_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: skip_check
        uses: fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions@master
        with:
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
          cancel_others: 'false'
          paths: '["src/**", "dist/**"]'
      - if: ${{ steps.skip_check.outputs.should_skip != 'true' }}
        run: |
          echo "Run only if src/ or dist/ changed..." && sleep 30
          echo "Do other stuff..."
```

### Option 3: Cancellation-only

If you do not care about the skip-features, then you can simply ignore the `should_skip`-output.
In this case, the integration reduces to three lines:

```yml
  - uses: fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions@master
    with:
      github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

## How does it work?

`skip-duplicate-actions` uses the [Workflow Runs API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#workflow-runs) to query workflow-runs.
`skip-duplicate-actions` will only look at workflow-runs that belong to the same workflow as the current workflow-run.
After querying such workflow-runs, it will compare them with the current workflow-run as follows:

- If there exists a workflow-runs with the same tree hash, then we have identified a duplicate workflow-run.
- If there exists an in-progress workflow-run that matches the current branch but not the current tree hash, then this workflow-run will be cancelled.

`skip-duplicate-actions` uses the [Repos Commit API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#get-a-commit) to perform an efficient backtracking-algorithm for paths-skipping-detection.
Moreover, a synergy with the cancellation-feature reduces the number of REST API calls.
